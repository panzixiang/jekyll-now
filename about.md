Hi I'm Sean! This is a blog for personal projects and other doodles. I'm a graduate of Princeton University (go Tigers!) class of 2016 majoring in mathematics. I am interested in natural language processing and computational linguistics and their roles in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction.
