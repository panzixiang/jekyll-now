## Part I: Getting the dataset
### The arXiv dataset

The [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) is a online repository of preprints of scientific papers in the fields of astronomy, physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance and statistics. To date it has more than a million papers and more are being added every day. This dataset I focused on is a relatively recent (2007-17) sample totaling approximately 800,000 pieces of metadata which I curated via a data dump using the arXiv APIs. They contain a significant number of papers from every category (>5000) submitted in the past decade.
