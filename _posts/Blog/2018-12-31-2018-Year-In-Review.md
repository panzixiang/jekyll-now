title: 2018 year in review

I have always felt that setting a particular rotation of the Earth in her revolution around the sun is arbitrary (sounds arbitrary already when you read that didn't it?). But well here goes.

2018 began not in the best ways for me, having to say one of the most painful goodbyes. It was a year of trying to "be" again, in many senses of that word. 

### Highlights

The highlight of the year was the hiking trip to Glacier National Park in July ([pictures here](https://www.panzixiang.com/Photo-blog/Glacier-NP-2017/)), it was a breathtaking foray into the natural world, but its fragility was all too apparent. It was also my first backcountry camping trip since graduation and it certainly boosted my confidence for trips to come.

### Goals
I had a few goals at the start of 2018: to start school (started at UW), to start a [photoblog](https://www.panzixiang.com), to read (26 books) more, to run a mile a day. I think in general these goals were attained to varying degrees. 

#### Books

[Goodreads Year in review](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2018/37606149)

Almost made it to the 26 pledged this year, will continue with the goal of 26 next year. I think the key here is still consistently finding time to read. I'm planning to get a Kobo Aura One in 2019 to motivate myself.

#### Favorite fiction: The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories by Ken Liu
#### Favorite non-fiction: Factfulness by Hans Rosling

#### Running

I ended the year around 270 miles in, which in January seemed an impossible number, but well here I am. It's not quite 365, but to come to this from a couch potato I think was a phase change.

This post feels corny and smug. I'll stop.
