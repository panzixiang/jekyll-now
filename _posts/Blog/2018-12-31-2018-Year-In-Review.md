title: 2018 year in review
category: Blog
---

I have always felt that setting a particular rotation of the Earth in her revolution around the sun is arbitrary (sounds arbitrary already when you read that didn't it?). But well here goes. 
2018 began not in the best ways, having to bid one of the most painful goodbyes. It made me introspective and yet fearful of those memories, only time and tears will tell. It was a year of trying to "be" again, in many senses of that word. 
It also made me more aware of the quality of the company I keep, and the dedication needed to treasure these relationships. I think we are coming to the age where it is harder to make real good friends, not because of the lack of motivation, but because of the lack of excess energy to maintain that new relationship. To the people whom I am lucky enough to call friend I would l's like to apologize for my lapses in judgment and I will let you know that I appreciate your words and deeds and prize our friendship.  

### Highlights

The highlight of the year was the hiking trip to Glacier National Park in July ([pictures here](https://www.panzixiang.com/Photo-blog/Glacier-NP-2017/)), it was a breathtaking foray into the natural world, but its fragility was all too apparent. It was also my first backcountry camping trip since graduation and it certainly boosted my confidence for trips to come.

### Goals
I had a few goals at the start of 2018: to start school (started at UW), to start a [photoblog](https://www.panzixiang.com), to read (26 books) more, to run a mile a day. I think in general these goals were attained to varying degrees. 

#### Books

[Goodreads Year in review](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2018/37606149)

Almost made it to the 26 pledged this year, will continue with the goal of 26 next year. I think the key here is still consistently finding time to read. I'm planning to get a Kobo Aura One in 2019 to motivate myself.

#### Favorite fiction: The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories by Ken Liu
#### Favorite non-fiction: Factfulness by Hans Rosling

#### Running

I ended the year around 270 miles in, which in January seemed an impossible number, but well here I am. It's not quite 365, but to come to this from a couch potato I think was a phase change.

This post feels corny and smug. I'll stop.
