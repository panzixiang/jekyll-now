### A whisky review

Bought a Monkey Shoulder Blended Malt Scotch Whisky from Trader Joes of all places, wanted to have an everyday bottle that is not too expensive to sip on. It's a blend of Speyside malts.

**Nose**: immediate scents of vanilla and caramel, something citrus, I do smell alcohol which is usually not a good sign. 

**Palate**: Strong malt, creamy, sweet, honey tones

**Finish**: medium, a little spicy.

For 20-something dollars before tax this is a steal.

### Snow update

Snow has finally started to melt, after what was a disastrous two weeks. It was almost up to my knees at some point in time. It made me realize that a carport is a necessity. Will start planting soon. Planning basil, thyme, oregano, sage, tarragon, lavender, peony tulips for the time being.

### Skiing

Going to Whistler this coming weekend, hope it will be fun. This ski season was fantastic, Vail was wonderful, a true pinnacle of a ski resort. Given the snow situation I think all of March is firmly in skiing season this year.
