I bought a house! Now let the trouble and worry begin.

I'm in crippling debt.

I realized all the knowledge I learnt up till now from formal schooling doesn't help jack around the house. How does a faucet work? No idea, how to properly use a power drill? Install a rack? Churn the soil? The helplessness is profound and unrelenting. 

Smart home is anything but, the ecosystem is so fragmented and the protocols so varied, that it takes significant domain knowledge to understand every piece of the puzzle and piece them together to a logical workflow for even the simplest daily tasks. It takes the meticulousness of a programmer and the patience of a I-don't-know-insert-a-patient-profession-here to get even localized domains of the home connected to each other. And don't even get me started on data privacy issues.

**Set small goals:** Make the flowerbed alive, furnish one room at a time. Set up smart appliances piece by piece.

On the plus side, all that overwhelming incompetence that the house made me feel initially is a perfect opportunity for me to learn all these things that should be common knowledge but sadly is not to me.

Been reading Howard Marks: 

>Risk means uncertainty about which outcome will occur and about the possibility of loss when the unfavorable ones do.
