### Elections

The 2020 election was a different kind of nail-biter, not because it was close, but rather because there is this lingering fear that trump supporters might do something stupid and violent. Biden has been declared president elect, and the orange nightmare will soon be over. But do not rush to rejoice, for trumpism is here to stay, and in four years it may well return with a vengeance, like a wave crashing onto shore. America is a nation deeply divided by the near unstoppable economic forces of our times, and Trump was just as much a product of the times as he had fueled the ambers of a disillusioned working class.

### Amazon

It has almost been a year since I switched jobs. Amazon feels much bigger, an endless networks of cogs and machines. An empire in every sense. 

### Whisky review

Good old Macallan 12, 43% ABV
I'm liking Highland more and more

**Nose**: very nice, woody, spicy, hint of fruit. 

**Palate**: very sweet for me, syrup, fruit, nutmeg, sweetness throughout to the finish

**Finish**: smooth, lingering sweetness

2020 is shaping up to be a La Nina year, which for PNW means lots of precipitation. But Covid has made planning difficult, with the additional reservation system at Washing ski resorts. Flying is a non-option at least until the new year.
